// authored (`app.json`) → published (`apps/{aid}`). The compilation step.
//
// THE WHOLE CONVERSION LIVES HERE. That is the point of the module, not a
// tidiness claim: the design note's D4 calls publish a compiler, and the
// failure it is guarding against is "I wrote what the sample shows and the
// rules refuse it". Every difference between what a human writes and what the
// rules read is either in this file or is a bug.
//
// What actually differs, and why:
//
//   window.from / window.until (ISO strings)  →  window.fromMs / untilMs (numbers)
//     The rules do not coerce a string to a timestamp. Comparing an ISO string
//     with `request.time` is a TYPE ERROR, and a rules type error denies. The
//     symptom is not an error message, it is "nobody can submit".
//
//   members                                   →  members + memberEmails
//     Denormalised so a client can ask "which apps am I in?" with
//     `array-contains`. It is DERIVED, never authored: `membersConsistent()`
//     refuses any write where the two disagree, so a hand-written value cannot
//     survive anyway — it can only make the whole publish fail with a
//     permission error that says nothing about the cause.
//
//   —                                         →  owner / publishedAt / publishedBy /
//                                                publishedCommit / previousPublished
//     Attribution and rollback. `owner` is a uid and the publisher's identity;
//     see `projectApp`'s parameter for why it is threaded in rather than read
//     from the declaration.
//
// WHAT DOES *NOT* CHANGE, and the temptation to make it change:
// `public.read` and `participantRead` stay ARRAYS. The rules test them with
// `cid in a.public.read`, which in the rules language means "is an element of"
// for a list and "is a key of" for a map — so a `{cid: true}` map would work
// equally well, and an earlier draft of the handoff note specified one. Two
// spellings that both work is exactly the kind of silent divergence this
// module exists to prevent, so the published form is the authored form and
// the emulator round-trip test (`../mulmoserver test/rules/rules_publish.ts`)
// pins that the rules accept it.
